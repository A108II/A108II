## Welcome to My GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹

### Hi there! I'm Ali Sa'adati, Software Engineer | Full-Stack developer

## My Passion and Drive

I'm driven by a deep passion for coding and creating. Regardless of the problem, I tackle it with the mindset that a solution is out there waiting to be found.

I live by a simple motto: "Progress over perfection." It's about moving forward, always learning, and growing with each step rather than getting hung up on achieving some unrealistic standard of flawlessness.
